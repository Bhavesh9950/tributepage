				Childhood friendships are one of the hardest relationships to maintain when you move forward into adulthood.<br> Whether you move away, fall out or simply drift apart, we always remember our childhood mates.<br> Because after all, it was these friends who were there for us as we navigated puberty!<br>

				Feelings for childhood friends showed by some quotes:)<br>

				<strong style="font-size:30px;"> It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can <br>afford to be stupid with them.</strong><br>Ralph Waldo Emerson
